## Responsibility
Core source tree for the ScrapeGoat MCP server — an extensible documentation indexing and search system for AI coding assistants.

## Design
Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Entry Layer** (`index.ts`, `app/`, `cli/`) — bootstrap, CLI parsing, service lifecycle
- **Service Layer** (`services/`, `events/`, `auth/`) — wires components together into runnable servers
- **Domain Layer** (`scraper/`, `pipeline/`, `splitter/`, `tools/`, `upload/`) — core business logic
- **Data Layer** (`store/`, `store/embeddings/`) — SQLite-backed document storage with vector search
- **Transport Layer** (`mcp/`, `web/`) — MCP stdio server + Fastify web dashboard
- **Cross-cutting** (`utils/`, `types/`, `telemetry/`) — shared utilities, config, logging, analytics

Uses dependency injection (constructor injection) throughout. Services are composed in `AppServer` and connected via tRPC for cross-process communication (WebSocket for browser ↔ server, in-process for CLI mode).

## Flow
1. `src/index.ts` boots: loads env, sanitizes, initializes Playwright, delegates to CLI
2. CLI parses command → configures `AppServerConfig` (which services to enable)
3. `AppServer` creates Fastify instance, registers services conditionally
4. MCP tools register on the MCP server → execute via `PipelineManager` → `ScraperService`
5. Scraped documents flow through `PipelineWorker` → fetcher → middleware → splitter → `DocumentStore`
6. Search queries hit `DocumentRetrieverService` → embedding generation → vector similarity → results
7. Web dashboard connects via tRPC WebSocket for real-time job progress

## Integration
- Consumed by: `dist/index.js` (compiled entry point), Docker entrypoint
- Depends on: external packages (Fastify, better-sqlite3, Playwright, tRPC, etc.)
